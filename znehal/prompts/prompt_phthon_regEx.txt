The questions should be conceptual and practical, covering syntax, patterns, and functions in Python's re module.
Each question should have four options (A, B, C, D), with only one correct answer.
The correct answer should be explicitly mentioned in the "answer" field.
The explanation should be clear, concise, and informative, explaining why the correct option is right.
Avoid repetition of concepts across multiple questions.
Include a mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced-level questions.
Provide a question that tests understanding of a specific aspect of Python regular expressions, such as pattern matching, character classes, or groups. 
Make sure the options are plausible but only one is correct.
